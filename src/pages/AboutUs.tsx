In 1994, Norwegian speed skater Johann Olav Koss led a humanitarian trip to Eritrea. There, he came face-to-face with the realities of life in a country emerging from decades of war – and with the power of play. Amid burned-out tanks, children played together, kicking a shirtball back and forth. The children’s incredible resilience in the face of hopelessness inspired Koss to found Right To Play.

Twenty years on, Right To Play has grown to reach millions of children in 14 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Indigenous communities in Canada. We create positive and safe environments where children can learn and succeed, and use play in all its forms to provide rich and engaged learning experiences both inside and outside the classroom.

Our vision is to support a generation of children to learn and develop through play so they can have a safe and joyful childhood and grow into thriving adults."
